## Security Importance:

* Remote wipe: it allows the administrator to wipe the sensitive data from the company device in case of device theft or lost.
* Rooting or Jailbreaking: it is the situation when the user breaks the securrity policies implied by administrator which makes the vulnerabilties unpatched,allows malware to attack the system, fraud happenings, and data theft.
* Containerization: simply putting the sensitive data of company in a separate container in the phone. Work files cannot escape this container and peronal data cannot peak through the container. Keeping the Data privacy.
